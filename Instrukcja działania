Say we want to encrypt/ decrypt a file named /home/user/sample.txt

Generate a keyfile using:

run_des.o -g /tmp/keyfile.key
Encrypt sample.txt using:

run_des.o -e /tmp/keyfile.key /home/user/sample.txt /home/user/sample.enc
Decrypt sample.txt using:

run_des.o -d /tmp/keyfile.key /home/user/sample.enc /home/user/sample_decrypted.txt
Don't lose the key file! you won't be able to decrypt an encrypted if you lose the keyfile.
